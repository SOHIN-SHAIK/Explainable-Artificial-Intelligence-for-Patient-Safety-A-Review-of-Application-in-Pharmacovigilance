# Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Patient Safety: A Review of Applications in Pharmacovigilance

This project explores the integration of **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** into **pharmacovigilance** to enhance patient safety. It reviews XAI techniques applied to detect, predict, and explain **adverse drug reactions (ADRs)**, supporting transparent and accountable decision-making in drug safety monitoring.

## Objectives

- Review current XAI methods applicable in pharmacovigilance.
- Demonstrate how AI can support adverse drug reaction detection.
- Highlight explainability as a critical factor for patient safety and regulatory acceptance.

## Key Concepts

- **Pharmacovigilance**: Monitoring the effects of drugs after they have been licensed for use.
- **XAI (Explainable AI)**: AI systems that offer transparent decision-making, especially critical in healthcare.
- **ADR Detection**: Identifying unexpected harmful effects of drugs.

## Features

- Survey of XAI models: SHAP, LIME, decision trees, attention mechanisms.
- Use of real-world datasets (e.g., FAERS) for ADR case studies.
- Evaluation of interpretability, accuracy, and reliability in AI predictions.
- Focus on regulatory implications and model transparency.

## Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**
- **XAI libraries**: SHAP, LIME, ELI5
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **NLP** (if text-based drug reports are analyzed)

## Dataset Examples

- FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
- WHO VigiBase (if accessible)
- Simulated ADR case datasets for testing model explanations

## Example Use-Case

1. Input: Patient drug history and symptoms
2. Model: Predict potential ADR
3. XAI Layer: Show key factors influencing prediction (e.g., SHAP plot)
4. Output: Human-understandable explanation for ADR risk
