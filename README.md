# 🧠🔍 Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Patient Safety: A Review of Application in Pharmacovigilance 💊⚕️

This project investigates the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) into pharmacovigilance to improve patient safety by detecting, predicting, and explaining Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). The approach enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven drug safety monitoring, supporting healthcare professionals and regulatory compliance.
